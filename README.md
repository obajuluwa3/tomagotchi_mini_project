## Skills & Lessons Learned
* Creating a single page layout using HTML & CSS
* Animating an image using JavaScript/JQuery

* Simulating dynamic content using intervals in JavaScript/JQuery

## Possible further development..
This was a fun project created to flex my HTML/CSS/JavaScript muscles. Would love to come back and build more functionality in the future such as:
* Pet customization intro screen where the user can select what type of pet they want and customize them
* Better animated pet interaction using JQuery, CSS and images.
